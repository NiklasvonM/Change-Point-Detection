# Change Point Detection in Random Fields

This repository contains the source for my master thesis "Change Point Detection in Random Fields" from 2023, based on the paper [Change-point detection and bootstrap for Hilbert space valued random fields](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2017.01.007).

You can compile the source by executing

```sh
latexmk -pdflatex
```

in ./src.
