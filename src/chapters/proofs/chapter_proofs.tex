\chapter{Proofs}

\label{chapter:proofs}

In this chapter, we first prove the results in \cite{[16]deo1975functional} regarding strongly separated blocks. The rest almost exclusively mirrors and expands the results and proofs presented in \cite{[0]BUCCHIA2017344} Section 4: We prove all preliminary results and afterwards the two main theorems.
