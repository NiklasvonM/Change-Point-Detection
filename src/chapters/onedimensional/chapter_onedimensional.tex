\chapter{Change in Mean Detection for Univariate Independent Observations}

\label{chapter:onedim}

This chapter serves to give an intuition behind the topics covered. Therefore, we are for now considering the case $d=p=1$, i.e., the random field is a stochastic process taking values in $\RR$. Furthermore, we impose the strong condition that the observations are independent and we only test for changes in the mean.

It turns out that this special case of Theorem \ref{theorem1} can be thought of as an extension of Donsker's theorem \ref{thm:donsker} which itself can be thought of as a generalization of the central limit theorem.

\begin{thm}[Donsker's Theorem] \label{thm:donsker}
    Let $X = (X_i)_{i \in \NN}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables that take values in $\RR$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2 > 0$. Define the partial sum process
    \[ S_n \coloneqq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu) \]
    and the rescaled random walk $W_n$ via
    \[ W_n(t) \coloneqq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} S_{\floor*{nt}}, \ t \in [0, 1]. \]
    Then, for each $n$, $W_n$ is a random variable in the Skorokhod space $\mathcal{D}[0, 1]$ and the sequence $(\frac{1}{\sigma}W_n)_n$ converges in distribution to a standard Brownian motion $W$ on $[0, 1]$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    The original proof may be found in \cite{donsker1951invariance}.
\end{proof}
